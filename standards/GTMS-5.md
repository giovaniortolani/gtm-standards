## Template repository file structure

### Problem that solved by this standard

There are no standards for the structure of the repository.
Because of this, the repository's structure is different for each project.

There is no requirement to store the code of a template in a separate file, however, it is hard to read the code of the template if it is not extracted to a separate file.

### Standard description

Required by GTM Template Gallery:
- LICENSE
- metadata.yaml
- template.tpl

Required by this standard:
- template.js - template code
- README.md - template description
